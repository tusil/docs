To start off, you'll need a React Native project. If you have an existing project, you can skip to [initialize a new backend](#initialize-a-new-backend).

##  Create a new React Native app

To get started, initialize a new React Native project.

 ###  Using Expo
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli  
expo init RNAmplify
```

###  Using the React Native CLI

```bash
npx react-native init RNAmplify
```

## Initialize a new backend

You are now ready to initialize a new Amplify project. To do so, change into the project directory

```bash
cd RNAmplify
```

and use the Amplify CLI to create the project:

```console
$ amplify init

? Enter a name for the project: rnamplify
? Enter a name for the environment: demo
? Choose your default editor: <Your favorite text editor>
? Choose the type of app that youre building: javascript
? What javascript framework are you using: react-native
? Source Directory Path:  /
? Distribution Directory Path: /
? Build Command:  npm run-script build
? Start Command: npm run-script start
? Do you want to use an AWS profile? Y
? Please choose the profile you want to use: <Your AWS profile from the configuration step>
```

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as a GraphQL API and authentication. As you add features, the `amplify` folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called `aws-exports.js` in the `src` directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file, adding some generated files to the ignore list.
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running `amplify console`. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources.

## Install Amplify libraries

Next, install the local Amplify dependencies. The directions here will depend on whether you are using Expo or the React Native CLI.

### Expo

With Expo, you only have to install the dependencies and then move on to the next step - [__Set up the frontend__](#set-up-the-frontend).

```bash
npm install aws-amplify aws-amplify-react-native @react-native-community/netinfo

# or

yarn add aws-amplify aws-amplify-react-native @react-native-community/netinfo
```

### React Native

If you've created the project using the React Native CLI, install these dependencies:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify aws-amplify-react-native amazon-cognito-identity-js react-native-vector-icons @react-native-community/netinfo

# or

yarn add aws-amplify aws-amplify-react-native amazon-cognito-identity-js react-native-vector-icons @react-native-community/netinfo
```

You will next need to change into the the ios directory and install the pod dependencies:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ../
```

Now open __ios/RNAmpIntr/Info.plist__ and add the following properties:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
  <string>AntDesign.ttf</string>
  <string>Entypo.ttf</string>
  <string>EvilIcons.ttf</string>
  <string>Feather.ttf</string>
  <string>FontAwesome.ttf</string>
  <string>FontAwesome5_Brands.ttf</string>
  <string>FontAwesome5_Regular.ttf</string>
  <string>FontAwesome5_Solid.ttf</string>
  <string>Foundation.ttf</string>
  <string>Ionicons.ttf</string>
  <string>MaterialIcons.ttf</string>
  <string>MaterialCommunityIcons.ttf</string>
  <string>SimpleLineIcons.ttf</string>
  <string>Octicons.ttf</string>
  <string>Zocial.ttf</string>
</array>
```

Finally, open __android/app/build.gradle__ and add the following line at the top of the file:

```groovy
apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/fonts.gradle"
```

## Set up the frontend

Finally, open __App.js__ (Expo) or __index.js__ (React Native CLI) and add the following lines of code at the top of the file below the last import:

```javascript
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify'
import config from './aws-exports'
Amplify.configure(config)
```

Now your project is set up and you can begin adding new features.
