## Step 1: Configure your app

You can use an existing Android app or create a new Android app using Java as per the steps in prerequisite section.

Modify your `project/build.gradle` with the following build dependency:

```groovy
classpath 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-appsync-gradle-plugin:2.9.+'
```

Next, add dependencies to your `app/build.gradle`, and then choose Sync Now on the upper-right side of Android Studio.

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.amazonaws.appsync'

dependencies {
    //Base SDK
    implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-core:2.15.+'
    //AppSync SDK
    implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-appsync:2.8.+'
    implementation 'org.eclipse.paho:org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3:1.2.0'
    implementation 'org.eclipse.paho:org.eclipse.paho.android.service:1.1.1'
}
```

Finally, update your AndroidManifest.xml with the following:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>

        <!--other code-->

    <application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
        android:supportsRtl="true"
        android:theme="@style/AppTheme">

        <service android:name="org.eclipse.paho.android.service.MqttService" />

        <!--other code-->
    </application>
```

**Build** your Android Studio project.

## Step 2: Initialize your project

In a terminal window, navigate to your project folder (the folder that typically contains your project level `build.gradle`) and run the following command (for this app, accepting all defaults is OK):

```bash
cd ./YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
amplify init
```

Accept the default values. An `awsconfiguration.json` file will be created with your configuration and updated as features get added to your project by the Amplify CLI. The file is placed in the `./app/src/main/res/raw` directory of your Android Studio project and automatically used by the SDKs at runtime.

**What is awsconfiguration.json?**

Rather than configuring each service through a constructor or constants file, the AWS SDKs for Android support configuration through a centralized file called `awsconfiguration.json` which defines all the regions and service endpoints to communicate. Whenever you run `amplify push`, this file is automatically created allowing you to focus on your application code. On Android projects, the `awsconfiguration.json` will be placed into the `./app/src/main/res/raw` directory.

## Step 3: Add API and Database

Add a [GraphQL API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/designing-a-graphql-api.html) to your app and automatically provision a database by running the the following command from the root of your application directory:

```bash
amplify add api
```

Accept the default values which are highlighted below:

```console
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services:
# GraphQL
? Provide API name:
# myapi
? Choose the default authorization type for the API:
# API Key
? Enter a description for the API key:
# demo
? After how many days from now the API key should expire:
# 7 (or your preferred expiration)
? Do you want to configure advanced settings for the GraphQL API:
# No
? Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema? 
# No
? Do you want a guided schema creation? 
# Yes
? What best describes your project: 
# Single object with fields
? Do you want to edit the schema now? 
# Yes
```

The CLI should open this GraphQL schema in your text editor.

__amplify/backend/api/myapi/schema.graphql__

```graphql
type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
}
```

The schema generated is for a Todo app. You'll notice a directive on the `Todo` type of `@model`. This directive is part of the [GraphQL transform](/cli/graphql-transformer/directives) library of Amplify. 

The GraphQL Transform Library provides custom directives you can use in your schema that allow you to do things like define data models, set up authentication and authorization rules, configure serverless functions as resolvers, and more.

A type decorated with the `@model` directive will scaffold out the database table for the type (Todo table), the schema for CRUD (create, read, update, delete) and list operations, and the GraphQL resolvers needed to make everything work together.

From the command line, press __enter__ to accept the schema and continue to the next steps.

## Step 4: Push changes

Create required backend resources for your configured API with the following command:

```bash
amplify push
```

Since you added an API the `amplify push` process will automatically enter the codegen process and prompt you for configuration. Accept the defaults which generate a `./app/src/main/graphql` folder structure with your statements.

Run a **Gradle Sync** and **Build** your app. The generated packages are automatically added to your project.

Next, run the following command to check Amplify's status:

```bash
amplify status
```

This will give us the current status of the Amplify project, including the current environment, any categories that have been created, and what state those categories are in. It should look similar to this:

```console
Current Environment: dev

| Category | Resource name | Operation | Provider plugin   |
| -------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Api      | myapi         | No Change | awscloudformation |
```
