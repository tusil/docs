title: Share single environment
description: auth
---

You have two independent environments (master & dev) in the cloud and have corresponding git branches with your amplify backend infrastructure code on Git. Suppose all team members want to work on the same Amplify project and push backend related changes to the same dev environment to test their changes. Each team member would run the following:

```bash
cd <project-dir>
amplify init
```

```console
Do you want to use an existing environment? Yes
Choose the environment you would like to use:
‚ùØ dev
master
# The rest of init steps
# amplify add/update 
amplify push
```

Since the team is sharing the same dev backend, periodically team members would need to pull in changes which their team members pushed for the dev environment to be in sync. Let's pull in the changes from the dev branch & environment.

```bash
amplify pull
```

## Sharing projects outside the team
Inside the amplify/ dir file-structure you will observe a **team-provider-info.json** file which contains a structure similar to the following:

```json
{
    "dev": {
        "awscloudformation": {
            "AuthRoleName": "multenvtest-20181115101929-authRole",
            "UnauthRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::132393967379:role/multenvtest-20181115101929-unauthRole",
            "AuthRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::132393967379:role/multenvtest-20181115101929-authRole",
            "Region": "us-east-1",
            "DeploymentBucketName": "multenvtest-20181115101929-deployment",
            "UnauthRoleName": "multenvtest-20181115101929-unauthRole",
            "StackName": "multenvtest-20181115101929",
            "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:132393967379:stack/multenvtest-20181115101929/fc7b1010-e902-11e8-a9bd-50fae97e0835"
        }
    },
    "master": {
        "awscloudformation": {
            "AuthRoleName": "multenvtest-20181115102119-authRole",
            "UnauthRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::345090917734:role/multenvtest-20181115102119-unauthRole",
            "AuthRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::345090917734:role/multenvtest-20181115102119-authRole",
            "Region": "us-east-1",
            "DeploymentBucketName": "multenvtest-20181115102119-deployment",
            "UnauthRoleName": "multenvtest-20181115102119-unauthRole",
            "StackName": "multenvtest-20181115102119",
            "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:345090917734:stack/multenvtest-20181115102119/3e907b70-e903-11e8-a18b-503acac41e61"
        }
    }
}
```

This file is to be shared between team members, so that they have the ability to push/provision resources to the same Cloudformation stack and that way teams can work in a push/pull way and can always be in sync with the latest state of the project in the cloud.

Note: Team members would only be able to push to a stack only if they have the correct credentials (access key/secret keys) to do so.

If you want to share a project publicly and open source your serverless infrastructure, you should remove or put the amplify/team-provider-info.json file in gitignore file.
