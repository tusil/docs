## Set up your backend

This will allow you to determine key phrases, sentiment, language, syntax, and entities from text. If you haven't already done so, run `amplify init` inside your project and then `amplify add auth` (we recommend selecting the *default configuration*).

Run `amplify add predictions`, then use the following answers:

```console
? Please select from one of the categories below
  Identify
  Convert
❯ Interpret
  Infer
  Learn More
  
? What would you like to interpret? (Use arrow keys)
❯ Interpret Text

? Provide a friendly name for your resource
  <Enter a friendly name here>

? What kind of interpretation would you like?
  Language
  Entity
  Keyphrase
  Sentiment
  Syntax
❯ All

? Who should have access?
  Auth users only
❯ Auth and Guest users
```

Run `amplify push` to create the resources in the cloud

## Working with the API

Here is an example of sending text for interpretation such as sentiment analysis or natural language characteristics. 

```swift
func interpret(text: String) {
  _ = Amplify.Predictions.interpret(text: text, options: PredictionsInterpretRequest.Options(), listener: { (event) in
    switch event {
    case .completed(let result):
      print(result)
    case .failed(let error):
      print(error)
    default:
      break
		}
  })
}
```
